### Project: InterNUS

InterNUS is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InterNUS can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created the internship class.
    * What it does: Allows the user to keep track of internship related information, namely company name, role, application status, interview date and contact person.
    * Justification: This abstraction of an internship is necessary to facilitate the storing and passing of information around for all other features involving internships.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to search persons and internships by multiple prefixes.
    * What it does: Allows the user to find persons and internships by their specific fields.
    * Justification: With a potentially very long list of persons and internships, this command is crucial for users to be able to easily find the information they want.

* **New Feature**: Added selectable color themes (currently available themes are light theme and dark theme)
    * What it does: Allows the user to choose the color scheme of the GUI.
    * Justification: Although purely cosmetic, GUI customization can improve the overall user experience of using the app as users get to personalize how they want the app to look and feel.
