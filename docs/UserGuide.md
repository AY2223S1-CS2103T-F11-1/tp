# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is InterNUS?

Welcome to the InterNUS user guide!

InterNUS is a convenient and powerful desktop app for NUS CS students to **manage internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It has a sleek design to track your internship status at one glance. 

Having troubles finding who to contact for your various internship applications? Don’t worry! InterNUS also allows you to manage contact person during your applications. After your internship, InterNUS can still be used to manage your work contact list!

## 1.2. Person List

Store the information of key contacts in InterNUS. During the internship-hunting period, add the contacts of hiring managers and link them to your bookmarked internship positions. What about the multiple colleagues you'll meet during your internship stints? InterNUS makes it easy to manage these contacts and lets you see at a glance where you worked at together.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** Each person can be linked to a maximum of one internship, and vice  versa.
</div>

## 1.3. Internship List

Track the internships you're interested in and all the relevant information -- the company, role, contact person and interview date. Awaiting a reply, or have you been accepted? With InterNUS, you can monitor and update the statuses of your internship applications effortlessly.

## 2.3. Command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listp`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest `InterNUS.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder which you want to use as the _home folder_ for your app.

4. Double-click the jar file to open the app. If the app does not respond, open your terminal in the current folder where `InterNUS.jar` is located and enter `java -jar InterNUS.jar` to open the app.

5. The screen should appear in a few seconds when the app first launches as shown in the figure below. Note how the app contains some sample data.

# 4. Features

## 4.1. Add Command

### 4.1.1. Adding a person: `add -p`

Saves a contact person into InterNUS, from the hiring manager you liaise with 
during the application process to the senior engineer you work with during the internship.

Format: `add -p n/NAME [e/EMAIL] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [t/TAG]…​ [l/LINK_INDEX] c/[COMPANY]`
* `PHONE_NUMBER` is considered valid if numeric and consists of at least 3 numbers.
  Duplicate persons are not allowed.
* `LINK_INDEX` refers to the displayed index of the internship the person is in charge of. 
Specified internship will be linked as the internship of the person.
* `TAG` must be alphanumeric and can only be one word.
* `COMPANY` refers to the company the contact person is working at.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** <br>
- Both the person list and internship list will remain sorted by the last given criterion
until InterNUS is closed. The sorted order persists during additions, deletions and editing of persons and internships.
- Adding persons maintains the current sorted order of the display list (as opposed to adding to the back of the list). By default, the list is sorted by date of creation.
- A person is assumed to be in charge of at most one internship position.
- A person is considered to be duplicate if there already exists a person in the list with the exact same name (case-sensitive).
- A person can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** 
Instead of typing the full status name, just enter the first letter of the intended status (e.g. `s/b` is a shortcut for `s/BOOKMARKED`).
</div>

Examples:
* `add -p` followed by `n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com p/98765432 l/1 c/Meta` 
adds the name, email, phone number and company and link to the internship with index **1**.
* `add -p` followed `n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com` 
adds the name, tags and email.

### 4.1.2. Adding an internship: `add -i`

Saves an internship into InterNUS. InterNUS will keep track of important details such as
the internship's contact person, application status and interview date (if any).

Format: `add -i c/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE s/STATUS [d/DATE_OF_INTERVIEW] [l/LINK_INDEX]`

* The link index (in add -i) refers to the index number shown in the person list.
* Valid statuses are `BOOKMARKED`, `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `COMPLETED` or `REJECTED` (case-insensitive).
* Date of interview is optional as interviews might not be scheduled yet.
* `LINK_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the person list and is optional. Specifying this parameter will define the current person at the specified index in the person list as the contact person of the newly added internship. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** 
Instead of typing the full status name, just enter the first letter of the intended status (e.g. `s/b` is a shortcut for `s/BOOKMARKED`).
Adding internships maintains the current sorted order of the display list (as opposed to adding to the back of the list). By default, the list is sorted by date of creation.
An internship is assumed to have at most one contact person.
Duplicate internships are not allowed.
An internship is considered to be duplicate if there already exists an internship in the list with the exact same company name and role (case-sensitive).
</div>

Examples:
* `add -i c/TikTok r/Data Engineer s/rejected l/1`
* `add -i c/Grab r/Full Stack Developer s/PENDING d/2020-12-20 12:00`
