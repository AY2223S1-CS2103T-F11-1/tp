# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is InterNUS?

InterNUS is a desktop app for **managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InterNUS can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## 1.2 Person List

Store the information of key contacts in InterNUS. During the internship-hunting period, add the contacts of hiring managers and link them to your bookmarked internship positions. What about the multiple colleagues you'll meet during your internship stints? InterNUS makes it easy to manage these contacts and lets you see at a glance where you worked at together.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** Each person can be linked to a maximum of one internship, and vice  versa.
</div>

## 1.3 Internship List

Track the internships you're interested in and all the relevant information -- the company, role, contact person and interview date. Awaiting a reply, or have you been accepted? With InterNUS, you can monitor and update the statuses of your internship applications effortlessly.

## 2.3 Command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listp`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
